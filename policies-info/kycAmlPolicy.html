          <div class="terms-text">
            The Company has created and enforces strict standards of KYC
            processes in order to maintain its commitment to ethical business
            practices and reduce any risks linked with money laundering,
            terrorist financing, and other illicit activities. These KYC
            policies/procedures cover a wide range of steps intended to confirm
            customers' identities, evaluate the source of their funds,
            continuously monitor transactions, and report any suspicious
            activity to the appropriate authorities as required by law. The
            Company seeks to foster openness, accountability, and confidence
            among its stakeholders while ensuring that its activities abide by
            all legal requirements by upholding these strict standards for KYC
            procedures. As a result, the Company's KYC policy and procedures are
            an essential component of its commitment to upholding a strong
            compliance culture and ethical business practices. The following
            actions are covered under these KYC policies and procedures:
          </div>
          <ul>
            <li>Client's identification</li>

            <li>
              When the relevant transaction has to be completed, KYC procedures
              are carried out.
            </li>
            <li>
              The identified hazards are taken into consideration while KYC

          <div class="terms-text">
            When evaluating the risks associated with AML/CTF, the company uses
            a risk-based approach (RBA). The following are the company's rules:
          </div>
          <div class="nbsp">&nbsp;</div>
          <ul>
            <li>
              To ensure that the client's identification does not match that of
              someone with a known criminal background, a banned entity, or a
              terrorist organization, the company conducts verification prior to
              any transaction.
            </li>
            <li>
              Before beginning the relevant transaction, the client must provide
              the necessary information.
            </li>
            <li>
              The process of determining a client's risk level may include
              evaluating the client's history, nation of origin, source of
              funds, and transaction volume.
            </li>
            <li>
              When it comes to clients who may be deemed high-risk based on the
              organization's findings, the company may conduct increased due
              diligence.
            </li>
            <li>
              When dealing with funds whose source is unknown or when dealing
              with more expensive or frequent transactions, the corporation may
              do greater due diligence.
